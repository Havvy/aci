        <h2>Today every point of interaction is also a point of entry. A single fraud incident can cost you countless customers, the dollars spent acquiring them, and the ongoing revenue they would provide.</h2>

        <h3>New opportunities give rise to new threats</h3>
        <p>The move to real-time payments requires real-time action, not after-the-fact responses. And the move to offer more payment channels requires more comprehensive, more consolidated detection. But a lack of options has forced today’s institutions to approach each type of fraud with a different solution, leading to disjointed systems with limited lines of sight that break down against sophisticated, multi-pronged attacks. </p>

        <h3>Tremendous visibility. Rapid reaction. A fraudster’s worst enemies.</h3>
        <p>ACI has built UP Payments Risk Management as part of an entire payments ecosystem.
